# enterprice_validator (Work in progress)


## Vision for project: 
The software will take a company name as input, then it will firstly find key compeditors in the relevant market.
It will then use that to generate key values, then evaluate the company based on itself and the competing market.
Then it will look for arbitrage opportunities, by measuring the differences between the intrinsic and extrinsic values.
[ Other ideas are yet to come ]
Then finally make a final recommendation for if the company would be a profitable investment, then find a propriate strategy for said investment.
